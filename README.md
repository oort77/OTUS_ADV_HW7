**Goals:**  

- Decribe the environment   ☑︎
- Apply the Q-Learning algorithm to find optimal policy   ☑︎
- Evaluate the optimal policy   ☑︎
- Visualize it  ☑︎

**Means:**  

- All meaningful programming will be done in [gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/).

**Implementation**
- Jupyter notebook to be run locally, as heavy animation makes colab implementation too slow.

**Notes**
- Training time on 10000 episodes takes about an hour. 
- In order to go straight to results of Q-learning you may skip the training phase entirely and   
go straight to experiments section that starts with "[Optionally] load Q_states". 
- All cells preceding "Q-learning algo" still need to be executed.
